I knew I wanted to do something with live health data - and displaying that on charts. Particularly infant health/infant growth rate data, since this is something new parents are particularly concerned about. And it's also a measure of society's health.  Getting good quality, relevant data was hard. I looked through WHO, CDC, Data.gov, Computational Health Departments in Universities, NY State/City data. Some issues were old data, poorly structured (not JSON), below average documentation of API. I still persisted.

### Step 1 was to get data from tables, put into an array and learn Chart.js

The information in these arrays is typed
